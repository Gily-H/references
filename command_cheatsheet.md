### *cp command examples*
```bash
# copy contents of file1 into file2 (created or overwritten) -- /file1 /file2
cp file1 file2

# copy contents of file1 into dir1 as another file named file1 -- /dir1/file1
cp file1 dir1

# copy contents of dir1 into dir2 (created if does not exist) -- /dir2/dir1
cp -R dir1 dir2

# copy all files ending in '.txt' to directory 'text_files'
cp *.txt text_files
```

### *mv command examples*
```bash
# if file2 does not exist, file1 renamed to file2, else if file2 exists replace contents with file1
mv file1 file2

# moves file1 and file2 to dir1 if it exists (error otherwise)
mv file1 file2 dir1

# if dir2 does not exist, rename dir1 to dir2, else if dir2 exists move dir1 into dir2
mv dir1 dir2

# move 'dir1' and all files ending in '.bak' into dir2
mv dir1 ../*.bak dir2
```

### *rm command examples*
```bash
# delete file1 and file2
rm file1 file2

# delete dir1 and dir2 including all contents
rm -r dir1 dir2

# delete all files that end in a '~' character
rm *~
```

### *compression examples*
```bash
# compression using gzip - will not save a copy of original file
gzip filename

# gzip decompression using -d
gzip -d filename.gz

# tar compression - # -c to create a new archive, -v for verbose output, -f specify arhive name
# maintains the original file/directory
tar -cvf <archive-name> <filename/directory>

# compressing a tar archive will output a file with extension .tar.gz
gzip directory.tar

# shorthand for compressing a tar archive - # -z denote a zipped archive, .tgz is an abbr for .tar.gz
tar -czvf directory.tgz <file/directory>

# unpack a .tgz file - # -x to expand the .tgz file
tar -xvf directory.tgz
```

# File Permissions
|Command|Description|Format|Example|
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-|
|su|Temporarily become the superuser. Requires superuser password. Opens a new shell as superuser|`su`|su|
|sudo|Temporarily become the superuser. Requires own password|`sudo <command>`|sudo apt get|
|chmod|Change permissions of a file or directory|`chmod <group of 3 octal digits (0-7)> <file/dir>`|chmod 777 some_file.txt|
|chown|Change ownership of a file/dir. Requires superuser privileges|`chown <desired_owner> <file/dir>`|sudo chown user2 text_file.txt|
|chgrp|Change group ownership of a file/dir. Must be owner of the file/dir to change the group|`chgrp <desired_group> <file/dir>`|chgrp group2 text_file.txt|

## **chmod**
Consider the permissions as a series of bits
|rwx|rw-|r--|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|111|110|100|

Find the binary representation of each group of bits
|111|110|100|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|7|6|4|

To change the permissions of a file or directory, use the numbers to represent permissions for the owner, group, public, respectively
```bash
# read write execute for owner, read write for group, read for everyone else
chmod 764 some_file.txt

# use shorthand to modify permissions - # + to add permissions, - to remove permissions
# add write permission for the owner of the file
chmod u+w <file>

# remove read and write permissions for the group of the file
chmod g-rw <file>

# add read permission for other users
chmod o+r <file>

# give owner full permissions, and give group and others read and execute permissions
chmod u=rwx,gr=rx <file>

# give everyone read permission
chmod a+r <file>

# remove all permissions for other users for all files in the given directory including the directory itself
chmod -R o-rwx <directory>
```

To change the owner of a file or directory, we can use the chown command. Only the root user is allowed to change the owner of a file/directory
```bash
# use the sudo command to act as the superuser
sudo chown <owner-name> <file/directory>
```

To change the group users of a file or directory, we can use the chgrp command
```bash
chgrp <group-name> <file/directory>
```
