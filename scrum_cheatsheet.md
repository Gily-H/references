# Scrum
A product management methodology

## Principles of Scrum

- Small working teams
- Embracing changing requirements
- Deliver finished work frequently
- Small batches
- Enable releasing product whenever required

## Characteristics of Scrum
- Teams are multi-disciplinary and self-organizing
- Metrics and deadlines are always visible
- Product progression happens in _sprints_
- Requirements are set in a _Product Backlog_
- Product is continuously tested as it is being developed

## Scrum Framework
1. Schedule a live demo with the customer
2. Make a functional product to show at the demo
3. Get feedback from the demo and use it for the next set of tasks


## Roles in Scrum

|Scrum Master| serves--> |Team Members| serves--> |Product Owner| serves--> |Client/Customer|

__Responsibilities__

|Product Owner|Scrum Team|Scrum Master|
|:-|:-|:-|
|- Profitability or ROI (return on investment)|- Typical team size (5-9)|- Represents management to the product|
|- Defines product features||- Cross-functional roles (testing, programming...)|- Enacts Scrum values and practices|
|- Prioritizes product features|- Self-organizing|- Ensure team is fully functional and productive|
|- Decides on a release date and release content||- Remove obstacles|
|- Able to change features and priority in an iteration||- Facilitate team meetings|
|- Accepts or rejects the result of an iteration||- Enable close cooperation across all roles and functions|
||- Shield team from external interferences|


## Scrum Artifacts
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Sprint Burndown Chart
- Scrum Team Velocity

### __Product Backlog__
- Complete list of functionality and features desired by the customer to be put into the product
- Single source of truth for requirements
- Should be managed by the _Product Owner_ (creation, prioritizing features)
- Reprioritized for each sprint

_Example of a Product Backlog_

_NOTE: The item at the top of the backlog is the next item that the team will work on_

|Priority|Item #|Description|Estimate|By|
|:-:|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|
|Very High|#1|The next item to be worked on|1 week|1 week|
|Very High|#2|The runner up item to be worked on|1 week|1 week|

### __Product Backlog Item__
Items in the Product Backlog can include: features, constraints, bugs/defects, user stories, requirements...

- Unit of deliverable work
- Has measurable business value
- Contains criteria for successful completion

### __Sprint Backlog__
- List of activities the team commits to for a single sprint
- Created by the Scrum Team
- Drawn from the Product Backlog items

### __Sprint Backlog Item__

- Single deliverable or activity
- Estimated in ideal hours
- Managed by a single Scrum Team member - Any member can add, delete or change the sprint backlog
- Ideally takes no more than 2 days of work
- Individuals sign up for the work (no assignments)
- Estimated work remaining is updated on a daily basis
- 

_Example of a Sprint Backlog_

_NOTE: When all sprint backlog items for a particular PBI are completed and delivered, the PBI is considered complete_

|PBI (Product Backlog Item)|Sprint Backlog Item|Hours Remaining|
|:-|:-|:-:|
|Fetch one day temp data from the weather provider system|Make server connect and authenticate to provider system|-|
|Fetch one day temp data from the weather provider system|Read provider's data directory|-|
|Fetch one day temp data from the weather provider system|Parse current temperature out of the data|-|


### __Sprint Burndown Chart__
- Shows work remaining for the sprint
- Updated daily
- Used by team members to adjust activities
- Used by Scrum master as a project management tool


### __Scrum Team Velocity__
- measure how much value a team delivers
- Enables product owner to plan releases and future work


## Ceremonies
- Sprint Planning Meeting
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### __Sprint Planning Meeting__
- Sprint goals are created = work to be done in the current sprint - Agreement between team and product owner
- Sprint backlog is created by the Scrum Team
	- Team selects the first PBI
	- Team identifies all tasks to be completed to deliver the PBI
	- Verify that the SBIs can fit into the sprint
	- Repeat process until sprint backlog is full
- Sprint Burndown chart is created


### __Daily Scrum__
Consistent daily meeting by the Scrum Team, facilitated by the Scrum Master (Daily standup - typically 15mins)
1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. What impediments are in your way?


### __Sprint Review__
- Team presents what was accomplished during the sprint and can demo the functional product
- Demo new features or underlying architecture (actual software, __not__ a powerpoint)
- Whole team participates
- Gain feedback from participants


### __Sprint Retrospective__
- Continuous Improvement
	- What is and is not working
- Whole team participates after the Sprint Review
1. What will we start doing
2. What will we stop doing
3. What will we continue doing




## Enterprise Scrum


### Scrum of Scrums
Scrum meeting for Scrum Masters, where attendees (organizational leaders) should have the power to make decisions on resource allocation
- Solve problems
- Remove impediments
- Coordinate multiple teams


### Epics
Very Large Backlog Items
- Will be broken down later into Product Backlog items

_Example: As a CTO I want to implement automated builds so that code quality improves_
